      Japanese Curry Rice or Karē Raisu (カレーライス) is an extremely popular

    <h3>
      <strong><u>For Serving</u></strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
      <li>Fujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables)</li>
      <li>Rakkyo (Japanese pickled scallion)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the onions into thin slices.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat a large heavy-bottomed pot on medium heat. When the pot is hot,
        add half of the butter, half of the oil, and the onions to the pot. Stir
        to coat the onions with the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté the onions, stirring once in a while, for about 20-25 minutes.
        Meanwhile, move on to the next step (but stir the onions and keep an eye
        on them). When the onions are wilted, reduce the stove's heat to medium
        low (as they tend to burn quickly). Once the onions are tender,
        translucent, and a bit caramelized, remove the pot from the heat and set
        aside until the beef is done searing.
      </li>
      <li>Peel and cut the russet potato in thirds.</li>
      <li>
        Then, cut each piece in half or quarters. Soak the pieces in water for
        15 minutes (or until added to the pot later on) to remove the starch.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel and cut the carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter turn
        between cuts
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean the mushrooms. I use a pastry brush and avoid washing mushrooms as
        they absorb moisture. However, it's okay to quickly rinse them. Then,
        cut them into thin slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate the ginger, measure the amount needed, and set aside. Mince the
        garlic clove (I skip it here as I use a garlic press).
      </li>
      <li>Cut the beef into 1½-inch (3.8 cm) cubes.</li>
      <li>
        Lightly sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Then, lightly coat the
        meat with flour.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking the Curry</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a carbon steel pan (or cast-iron skillet) on medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the remaining oil and butter. Cook the beef in 2 batches. Add the beef cubes in a single layer, making sure not to crowd the skillet; otherwise, the excess moisture in the pan will end up "steaming" the meat.</li>
        <li>Sear the beef cubes (do not move them) on one side until brown and crusty, about 3-4 minutes, then turn them over to cook all sides. The meat will release itself from the pan when the surface is seared nicely. Transfer the seared meat to a plate and work on the next batch.</li>
        <li>Once you've seared all the meat and transferred it to the plate, deglaze the pan. Add the wine to the pan and use a wooden blunt-end spatula to release the flavorful browned bits (called the "fond") that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and set aside this deglazed pan liquid temporarily.</li>
        <li>By now, the onions in the pot should be caramelized and ready for the next step. Reheat the pot on the stove over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger.</li>
        <li>Add the curry powder and tomato paste and sauté for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the seared beef, any juices from the plate, and the deglazed pan liquid to the pot and mix them all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, letting the alcohol from the wine evaporate.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and mushrooms and mix them all together. Add the beef stock to just cover the ingredients. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-skim-off-the-scum-and-fat-from-soups-and-stocks/" target="_blank">skim off the scum and fat from the broth.</a> I prepare a 2-cup measuring cup with water in it and clean my fine-mesh skimmer in the water. It’s easy to remove the scum/fat from the skimmer this way.</li>
        <li>Grate the apple and add it to the broth. Then, add the Worcestershire sauce and milk.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leaf and cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid. (Tip: Compared to Le Creuset, I think Staub has a great seal on the lid and prevents evaporation). Simmer on low heat until the meat is tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. (Tip: To get tender beef, 2 hours of simmering is standard.) If you do not have a tight-fitting lid, you may need to add more beef stock or water, enough to just cover the ingredients.</li>
        <li>When the beef is tender, add the potatoes, close the lid, and simmer for 15 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are tender (and a wooden skewer can pierce through the potato), turn off the heat and discard the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Put 1-2 cubes of the curry roux in a ladleful of cooking liquid, slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks, and stir it into the broth to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Adjust the amount of curry roux to your taste. You may not need to use all the roux; reserve the extra cubes for another use. (Keep the leftover roux in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator/freezer for 1-3 months.) After adding the curry roux, simmer on the lowest heat, stirring often, for 3-5 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Be careful not to burn the curry sauce! If the sauce is too thick, add water to dilute. If the sauce is still too thin and soupy, uncover the pot and simmer a bit longer.</li>
    </ol>
