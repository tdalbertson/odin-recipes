    </ol>
    <h3>Making the Sesame Tonkatsu Sauce (Optional)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Grind the white and black toasted sesame seeds with a mortal and pestle. Leave some seeds unground for texture.</li>
      <li>In individual small plates or bowls, serve 1 Tbsp of the ground sesame seeds and add tonkatsu sauce - mix together when ready to eat.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making Fresh Panko</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put store-bought dry panko in a deep dish and spray with water until the panko is moist. Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the panko becomes soft and tender.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the Pork</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>With a sharp knife, remove the extra fat and make several slits on the connective tissue between the meat and the fat.</li>
        <li>Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of the connective tissue.</li>
        <li>Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a meat tenderizer.</li>
        <li>Mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Breading the Pork</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Crack the egg in a deep dish and add the oil. Whisk together until well combined. By adding oil, the meat and breading won’t detach from each other while deep-frying and the juice and flavor from the meat will not escape easily. Prepare a deep dish for the flour, too.</li>
      <li>Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Excess flour will create a coating that prevents the egg mixture from adhering to the pork. Then, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well.
      </li>
      <li>Dredge the pork in the panko, gently pressing down the panko onto the pork and then gently shaking off any excess before placing the pork pieces onto a tray or plate. While deep-frying, the panko will “puff up,” so at this stage they don’t have to be fluffy. Set it aside for 5-10 minutes so the breading will set.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Deep-frying</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the oil to the pot and bring it to 340ºF (170ºC) over medium heat. If you don’t have a thermometer, stick a chopstick in the oil and see if tiny bubbles start to appear around the tip of the chopstick. Alternatively, you can drop one piece of panko into the oil; if it sinks down to the <strong>middle of the oil</strong> and immediately pops back up to the surface, then the oil is ready.</li>
      <li>Gently put <strong>one piece of pork</strong> into the oil and cook for <strong>1 minute</strong> (without flipping). <strong>Don't touch the pork</strong> for 30 seconds. Why one piece? You don't want to reduce the oil temperature drastically. The size of the bubbles should be big when you add the pork. Keep watching the oil temperature and make sure it doesn’t go over 340ºF (170ºC) or else the breading will get dark too quickly while the pork will be undercooked.</li>
      <li>After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Take out the pork and remove excess oil by holding it vertically over the pot for a few seconds while the oil drips off. Place it on a wire rack or paper towel and let it sit for 4 minutes. The hot oil on the exterior will slowly continue to cook the meat as it sits.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat temporarily and scoop up and discard any fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer. It’s very important to keep the oil clean and crumb free so the oil does not get darker and dirtier with burnt crumbs. Turn on the heat and bring the oil back to 340ºF (170ºC).</li>
      <li>While the first cutlet is resting on the wire rack, deep fry the second piece of pork for 1 minute without flipping. Remember not to touch it for 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Take out the pork and remove the excess oil as before. Place it on the wire rack and let the residual heat cook the pork for 4 minutes. Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer.</li>
      <li>The first piece of pork should be ready for its second frying. Bring the oil to <strong>355ºF (180ºC)</strong> and fry the pork for <strong>30 seconds</strong> on each side. Remove from the pot and drain the excess oil by holding the cutlet vertically over the wire rack or paper towels for 2 minutes. This prevents the breading from getting soggy on one side.</li>
      <li>Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the oil, then continue the second frying of the second cutlet. Remove from the pot and drain the excess oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving the Tonkatsu</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the tonkatsu into ¾-inch (2 cm) wide pieces.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a plate and serve it with the shredded cabbage and cucumber, the sesame dressing in a small cup, and the sesame tonkatsu dipping sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
